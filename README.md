## Description

<!-- Eyes go brrr -->
Faux Noir et Blanc is a dark theme with the main focus of black and white colors. Use it with [Keen neutral icon theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keenethics.keen-neutral-icon-theme) for ultimate concentration after instant blindness.  

Originally from [orhun's Black Waves Theme](https://github.com/orhun/Black-Waves)

The main difference from orhun's is the use of colors, but staying true to the original theme's vision by adding the bare minimum amount of colors.
