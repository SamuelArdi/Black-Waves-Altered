# Black Waves Theme for VSCode

![Demo](https://github.com/SamuelArdi/Black-Waves-Altered/blob/master/images/demo.png)

## Description

<!-- Eyes go brrr -->
Black Waves is a dark theme with black + white and slightly {purple, white} ish colors. Use it with [Keen neutral icon theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keenethics.keen-neutral-icon-theme) for ultimate concentration after instant blindness.  

The main difference from orhun's is the use of colors, but staying true to the original theme's vision by adding the bare minimum amount of colors.

Originally from [orhun's Black Waves Theme](https://github.com/orhun/Black-Waves)
